{"Status":"Endangered","Population":1200,"Scientific Name":"<em>Platanista gangetica gangetica</em>","Weight":"330-374 pounds","Length":"7-8.9 feet","Habitats":"Freshwater rivers","description":"Dolphins are one of the oldest creatures in the world along with some species of turtles, crocodiles and sharks. The Ganges river dolphin was officially discovered in 1801. Ganges river dolphins once lived in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. But the species is extinct from most of its early distribution ranges.\r\n\nThe Ganges river dolphin can only live in freshwater and is essentially blind. They hunt by emitting ultrasonic sounds, which bounces off of fish and other prey, enabling them to &ldquo;see&rdquo; an image in their mind. They are frequently found alone or in small groups, and generally a mother and calf travel together. Calves are chocolate brown at birth and then have grey-brown smooth, hairless skin as adults. Females are larger than males and give birth once every two to three years to only one calf.","locations":["Eastern Himalayas"],"name":"Ganges River Dolphin"}
