When the sea dried up approximately 50 million years ago, the dolphins were forced to adapt to its only remaining habitatâ€”rivers. Today, they can only be found&nbsp;in the lower parts of the Indus River in Pakistan and in River Beas, a tributary of the Indus River in Punjab, India. In Pakistan, their numbers declined dramatically after the construction of an irrigation system, and most dolphins are confined to a 750 mile stretch of the river and divided into isolated populations by six barrages. They have adapted to life in the muddy river and are functionally blind. They rely on echolocation to navigate, communicate and hunt prey including prawns, catfish, and carp.","locations":[null],"name":"Indus River Dolphin"}
