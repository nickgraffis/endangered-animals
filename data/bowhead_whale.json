{"Status":"Least Concern","Population":10000,"Scientific Name":"<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>","Weight":"75-100 tons","Length":"Average of 50 - 60 feet","Habitats":"Ocean","description":"This predominantly Arctic species is associated with ice floes. Its movement patterns are therefore influenced by the melting and freezing of the ice.\r\n\nBowhead whales are capable of breaking through sea ice at least seven inches thick with their&nbsp;large skulls and powerful bodies.\r\n\nAdult bowheads are entirely black except the front part of the lower jaw which is white and prominently upturned. They can grow up to 60 feet long while still being able to leap entirely out of water. Bowheads filter their food through baleen by opening their mouths and straining plankton from the surface, the water column, or the sea floor.\r\n\nData has shown that bowhead whales may be among the longest-lived animals on earth. Based on the recovery of stone harpoon tips in their blubber, and from analysis of eye tissue, scientists believe that the life-span of bowhead whales can be over 200 years.","locations":["Arctic"],"name":"Bowhead Whale"}
