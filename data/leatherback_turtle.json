{"Status":"Vulnerable","Scientific Name":"<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>","Weight":"600-1500 pounds","Length":"55-63 inches","Habitats":"Oceans","description":"Leatherback turtles are named for their shell, which is leather-like rather than hard, like other turtles.\r\n\nThey are the largest sea turtle species and also one of the most migratory, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Pacific leatherbacks migrate from nesting beaches in the Coral Triangle all the way to the California coast to feed on the abundant jellyfish every summer and fall.\r\n\nAlthough their distribution is wide, numbers of leatherback turtles have seriously declined during the last century as a result of intense egg collection and fisheries bycatch. Globally, leatherback status according to IUCN is listed as Vulnerable, but many subpopulations (such as in the Pacific and Southwest Atlantic) are Critically Endangered.","locations":["Mesoamerican Reef","Coastal East Africa","Gulf of California","The Gal√°pagos","Coral Triangle"],"name":"Leatherback Turtle"}
