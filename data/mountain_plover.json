{"Status":"Near Threatened","Population":15000,"Scientific Name":"<em>Charadrius montanus</em>","Height":"5-9 inches","Weight":"3.6 ounces","Length":"8-10 inches","Habitats":"Grasslands","description":"Mountain plovers are one of only 12 grassland birds endemic to the western Great Plains. They nest across the western Great Plains and Rocky Mountain states, from the Canadian border to northern Mexico, and winter in California, southern Arizona, Texas and Mexico. Mountain plovers only nest in areas with sparse vegetation or bare ground, such as prairie dog towns. Loss of these areas because of crop planting or the removal of prairie dogs, is the biggest threat to the mountain plover's population.","locations":["Northern Great Plains"],"name":"Mountain Plover"}
