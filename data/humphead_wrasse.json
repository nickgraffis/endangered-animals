{"Status":"Endangered","Scientific Name":"<em>Cheilinus undulatus</em>","Weight":"over 400 pounds","Length":"6 feet","Habitats":"Oceans","description":"The humphead wrasse is an enormous coral reef fish—growing over six feet long—with a prominent bulge on its forehead. Some of them live to be over 30 years old. They roam through coral reefs in search of hard shelled prey such as mollusks, starfish, or crustaceans.\r\n\nWWF urges local governments in the Coral Triangle to stop the trade and consumption of humphead wrasse—one of the most expensive live reef fishes in the world. Live reef fish trade in Southeast Asia continues to be a significant problem that threatens the region’s food security as well as its reefs, as poachers often resort to legal and destructive fishing methods to catch them.","locations":["Coral Triangle","Coastal East Africa"],"name":"Humphead Wrasse"}
