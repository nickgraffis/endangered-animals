{"Status":"Least Concern","Population":1,"Scientific Name":"<em>Antilocarpa americana</em>","Height":"Approximately 3 feet at the shoulder","Weight":"110 - 125 pounds","Length":"39-59 inches","Habitats":"grasslands, deserts","description":"The pronghorn antelope is the fastest hoofed animal in North America and is capable of reaching speeds up to 60 mph. During the winter of 2011, WWF monitored a pronghorn herd that made the longest terrestrial migration in the U.S.'s lower 48 states. Most pronghorn populations remain stable, but have experienced a historic decline. Pronghorn follow the same migration corridors year after year, generation after generation. Today, the thoroughfares that link the summer breeding grounds and winter grazing areas are being fragmented by roads, cities, fences and energy development. These fragmentations threaten the migratory routes and survival of pronghorn.","locations":["Northern Great Plains"],"name":"Pronghorn"}
