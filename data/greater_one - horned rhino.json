{"Status":"Vulnerable","Population":3700,"Scientific Name":"<em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>","Height":"5.75 - 6.5 feet","Weight":"4,000-6,000 pounds","Length":"10- 12.5 feet","Habitats":"Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands","description":"The greater one-horned rhino (or “Indian rhino”) is the largest of the rhino species. Once widespread across the entire northern part of the Indian sub-continent, rhino populations plummeted as they were hunted for sport or killed as agricultural pests. This pushed the species very close to extinction and by the start of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, around 200 wild greater one-horned rhinos remained.\r\n\nThe recovery of the greater one-horned rhino is among the greatest conservation success stories in Asia. Thanks to strict protection and management from Indian and Nepalese wildlife authorities, the greater one-horned rhino was brought back from the brink. Today populations have increased to around 3,700 rhinos in northeastern India and the Terai grasslands of Nepal.\r\n\nThe greater one-horned rhino is identified by a single black horn about 8-25 inches long and a grey-brown hide with skin folds, which gives it an armor-plated appearance. The species is solitary, except when adult males or rhinos nearing adulthood gather at wallows or to graze. Males have loosely defined home ranges that are not well defended and often overlap. They primarily graze, with a diet consisting almost entirely of grasses as well as leaves, branches of shrubs and trees, fruit, and aquatic plants.","locations":["Eastern Himalayas"],"name":"Greater One - Horned Rhino"}
