They are less likely to be hunted for their meat or shell compared to other&nbsp;sea turtles. Bycatch, the accidental capture of marine animals in fishing gear, is a serious problem for loggerhead turtles because they frequently come in contact with fisheries.\r\n\nLoggerheads are the most common turtle in the Mediterranean, nesting on beaches from Greece and Turkey to Israel and Libya. Many of their nesting beaches are under threat from tourism development.&nbsp;Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years. They are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems and help maintain the health of coral reefs and sea grass beds.","locations":["Mesoamerican Reef","Coastal East Africa","Gulf of California","Coral Triangle"],"name":"Loggerhead Turtle"}
