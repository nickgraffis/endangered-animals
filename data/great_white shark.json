{"Status":"Vulnerable","Scientific Name":"<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>","Weight":"4,000-7,000 pounds","Length":"16-20 feet","Habitats":"Oceans","description":"The great white shark is the world's largest known predatory fish. It has 300 teeth, yet does not chew its food. Sharks rip their prey into mouth-sized pieces which are swallowed whole. The shark&rsquo;s heavy, torpedo-shaped body allows it to cruise efficiently for long periods of time, and then suddenly switch to high speed bursts in pursuit of prey&mdash;sometimes leaping out of the water. It feeds on a broad spectrum of prey, from small fish, such as halibut, to large seals and dolphins.","locations":["Gulf of California","Southern Chile","The Gal√°pagos","Coastal East Africa"],"name":"Great White Shark"}
