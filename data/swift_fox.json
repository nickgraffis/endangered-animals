{"Status":"Least Concern","Scientific Name":"<em>Vulpes velox</em>","Height":"12 inches","Weight":"5-7 pounds","Length":"23-34 inches","Habitats":"Short- and mixed-grass prairies of the Great Plains of North America","description":"Although historically common and widely distributed in short- and mixed-grass prairies of the Great Plains, swift foxes have experienced significant population declines and are now estimated to occupy less than half of their historic range in the United States. In the face of this enormous decline, a multi-stakeholder, comprehensive approach is required to restore swift fox populations across the Northern Great Plains and beyond. Collaboration among tribal communities, universities, conservation organizations, state and government agencies, and private landowners is essential for the swift fox to make a viable comeback.","locations":["Northern Great Plains"],"name":"Swift Fox"}
