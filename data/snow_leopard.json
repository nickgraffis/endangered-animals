{"Status":"Vulnerable","Population":4000,"Scientific Name":"<em>Panthera uncia</em>","Weight":"60-120 lbs.","Length":"2-5 ft.","Habitats":"high mountains","description":"The snow leopard’s powerful build allows it to scale great steep slopes with ease. Its hind legs give the snow leopard the ability to leap six times the length of its body. A long tail enables agility, provides balance and wraps around the resting snow leopard as protection from the cold.\r\n\nFor millennia, this magnificent cat was the king of the mountains. The mountains were rich with their prey such as blue sheep, Argali wild sheep, ibex, marmots, pikas and hares. The snow leopard’s habitat range extends across the mountainous regions of 12 countries across Asia: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The total range covers an area of close to 772,204 square miles, with 60% of the habitat found in China.&nbsp;However, <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/more-than-70-of-snow-leopard-habitat-remains-unexplored\">more than 70% of snow leopard habitat remains unexplored</a>.&nbsp;Home range sizes can vary from 4.6-15.4 square miles in Nepal to over 193 square miles in Mongolia. And population density can range from &lt;0.1 to 10 or more individuals per 38.6 square miles, depending on prey densities and habitat quality. Nevertheless, the snow leopard population is very likely declining.","locations":["Eastern Himalayas","Yangtze"],"name":"Snow Leopard"}
