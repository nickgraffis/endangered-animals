They are dependent on the presence of smaller animals (most often lemmings) to survive.&nbsp; Arctic foxes also hunt for sea birds, fish, and other marine life. Smaller rodent populations waver between times of abundance and scarcity, which leaves the Arctic fox vulnerable when these creatures are low in numbers.","locations":[null],"name":"Arctic Fox"}
