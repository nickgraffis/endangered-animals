{"Status":"Least Concern","Population":80000,"Scientific Name":"<em>Monodon monoceros</em>","Weight":"up to 4200 pounds","Length":"up to 17 feet","Habitats":"Oceans","description":"The narwhal looks like a cross between a whale and a unicorn with its long, spiraled tusk jutting from its head. Males most commonly have tusks, and some may even have two. The tusk, which can grow as long as 10 feet, is actually an enlarged tooth. Ongoing research by WWF collaborators indicates that the tusk has sensory capability, with up to 10 million nerve endings inside. The tusk may also play a role in the ways males exert dominance.\r\n\nNarwhals spend their lives in the Arctic waters of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Russia. The majority of the worldâ€™s narwhals winter for up to five months under the sea ice in the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait area (between Canada and western Greenland). Cracks in the ice allow them to breathe when needed, especially after dives, which can be up to a mile and a half deep. They feed mainly on Greenland halibut, along with other fish, squid and shrimp.","locations":["Arctic"],"name":"Narwhal"}
