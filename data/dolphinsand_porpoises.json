{"Habitats":"Oceans and freshwater rivers","description":"Dolphins and porpoises delight us with their playful antics and warm our hearts with their friendly faces. Marine species are the most well-known, but there are several species that live in freshwater rivers. All are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals that nurse their young. The difference between a dolphin and a porpoise has to do with their appearance: dolphins have longer snouts, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises.","locations":["Yangtze","Southern Chile","Arctic"],"name":"Dolphinsand Porpoises"}
