{"Status":"Endangered","Population":1500,"Scientific Name":"<em>Elephas maximus borneensis</em>","Height":"8.2 - 9.8 feet","Habitats":"Forests","description":"The smallest Asian elephant subspecies, Bornean elephants are distinctly smaller than their mainland cousins. They have long tails that sometimes touch the ground, relatively large ears, and straighter tusks. While they are also known as Borneo pygmy elephants due to their smaller size, at 8.2-9.8 feet tall, the Bornean elephant is the largest mammal on the island. \r\n\nOnce believed to be remnants of a domesticated herd given to the Sultan of Sulu in the 17th century, Bornean elephants were determined by WWF to be genetically different from other Asian elephants. DNA evidence proved that these elephants were isolated about 300,000 years ago from their cousins on mainland Asia and Sumatra.","locations":["Borneo and Sumatra"],"name":"Bornean Elephant"}
