{"Status":"Critically Endangered","Scientific Name":"<em>Eretmochelys imbricata</em>","Weight":"90-150 pounds","Length":"30-35 inches","Habitats":"Oceans","description":"Hawksbills are named for their narrow, pointed beak. They also have a distinctive pattern of overlapping scales on their shells that form a serrated-look on the edges. These colored and patterned shells make them highly-valuable and commonly sold as \"tortoiseshell\" in markets.\r\n\nHawksbills are found&nbsp;mainly throughout the world's tropical oceans,&nbsp;predominantly in coral reefs. They feed mainly on sponges by using their narrow pointed beaks to extract them from crevices on the reef, but also eat sea anemones and jellyfish.&nbsp;Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years. They are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems and help maintain the health of coral reefs and sea grass beds.","locations":["Mesoamerican Reef","Coastal East Africa","Coral Triangle"],"name":"Hawksbill Turtle"}
