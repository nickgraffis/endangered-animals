{"Status":"Endangered","Scientific Name":"<em>Thunnus Thynnus</em>","Weight":"1500 pounds","Length":"6 - 10 feet","Habitats":"Oceans","description":"Bluefin are the largest tunas and can live up to 40 years. They migrate across all oceans and can dive deeper than 3,000 feet. Bluefin tuna are made for speed: built like torpedoes, have retractable fins and their eyes are set flush to their body. They are tremendous predators from the moment they hatch, seeking out schools of fish like herring, mackerel, and even eels. They hunt by sight and have the sharpest vision of any bony fish. There are three species of bluefin: Atlantic (the largest and most endangered), Pacific, and Southern. Most catches of the Atlantic bluefin tuna are taken from the Mediterranean Sea, which is the most important bluefin tuna fishery in the world.","locations":["Coral Triangle"],"name":"Bluefin Tuna"}
