{"Status":"Critically Endangered","Population":200,"Scientific Name":"<em>Gorilla gorilla diehli</em>","Height":"4 to 5 ½ feet when standing on two feet","Weight":"up to 440 pounds","description":"This subspecies of the western gorilla is very similar in appearance to the more numerous western lowland gorilla, but subtle differences can be found in the skull and tooth dimensions. Cross River gorillas live in a region populated by many humans who have encroached upon the gorilla’s territory—clearing forests for timber and to create fields for agriculture and livestock. Poaching occurs in the forests as well, and the loss of even a few of these gorillas has a detrimental effect on such a small population.\r\n\nEfforts to protect these animals are focused on securing the forests that house them. WWF and partners have worked with the governments of Cameroon and Nigeria to create a protected area for the Cross River gorilla that spans the border of these two nations.","locations":["Congo Basin"],"name":"Cross River Gorilla"}
