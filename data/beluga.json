Their bulbous forehead, called a \"melon&rdquo;, is flexible and capable of changing shape. This allows them to make different facial expressions. Belugas can produce a series of chirps, clicks, whistles and squeals, which give the beluga its other name, \"the canary of the sea.\" They may sound like music or even nonsense to us, but to fellow belugas they convey important information.\r\n\nMany populations of belugas migrate as the sea ice changes in the Arctic. They move south in the fall as the ice forms and then return to feed again in the spring, as the ice breaks up. They can also be found near river mouths, and sometimes even venture up river. Belugas feed on a variety of fish species, such as salmon and herring, as well as shrimp, crabs and mollusks.","locations":["Arctic"],"name":"Beluga"}
