{"Status":"Endangered","Population":370,"Scientific Name":"<em>Mustela nigripes</em>","Weight":"1.5-2.5 pounds","Length":"18 -24 inches","Habitats":"Grasslands","description":"Saving rare species from extinction requires extraordinary measures. The black-footed ferret is one of North Americaâ€™s most endangered mammals. Once thought to be extinct, after the species was rediscovered in Wyoming in 1981, concerted efforts by numerous partners have given black-footed ferrets a second chance for survival. Captive breeding, reintroductions, habitat protection, and cloning have helped restore them to over 300 animals in the wild. Although great strides have been made to recover the black-footed ferret, habitat loss and disease remain their key threats. Biologists estimate that there should be 3,000 adult ferrets in the wild to successfully recover this endangered species.","locations":["Northern Great Plains"],"name":"Black -footed Ferret"}
