{"Scientific Name":"<em>Danaus plexippus</em>","Weight":"less than half a gram","Length":"Wingspan 4 IN.","Habitats":"Forests, Mountains","description":"Monarch butterflies embark on a marvelous migratory phenomenon. They travel between 1,200 and 2,800 miles or more from the northeast United States, and southeast Canada to the mountain forests in central Mexico, where they find the right climate conditions to hibernate from the beginning of November to mid-March. The monarch butterfly is known by scientists as <em>Danaus plexippus</em>, which in Greek literally means \"sleepy transformation.\" The name evokes the species' ability to hibernate and metamorphize. Adult monarch butterflies possess two pairs of brilliant orange-red wings, featuring black veins and white spots along the edges. Males, who possess distinguishing black dots along the veins of their wings, are slightly bigger than females. Each adult butterfly lives only about four to five weeks.","locations":[null],"name":"Monarch Butterfly"}
